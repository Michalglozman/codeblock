### Online Coding Web Application
https://codeblock-ten.vercel.app/

## Overview
This project is an online coding web application designed to facilitate real-time remote coding sessions between a mentor and a student. The application features a lobby for selecting code blocks and a collaborative coding environment where the mentor can observe the student's code changes in real-time.

# Features
Lobby Page

- Displays a list of at least four code blocks.
- Each code block is represented by a name 
- Clicking on a code block takes the user to the corresponding code block page.
  
Code Block Page
Allows two users to enter: one mentor and one student.
The mentor sees the code block in read-only mode.
The student can edit the code block. Code changes are displayed in real-time. 

Each code block may have a different "solution" defined.
When the student's code matches the solution, a big smiley face is displayed on the screen.
(If its hard there is a hint button ðŸ˜‰)
